      Today, I finally hosted my react application. I then moved my nav bar over to a seperate file from the app.js to make it less confusing in Explorer tab.
      I have made the nav bar have a function. When I click onto the internship logs it takes you to this page, and when you click onto the home page it takes you back to a 
      blank page. This is going to be temporarily blank. I am going to add a quick about me section on the first page so it is not empty. When you flip back and forth from
      the tabs the nav bar stays while underneath renders, thus saving time and energy. I also learned how to refresh a deployed react app. All in all a very successful day in
      my opinion.

      Today, we had a meeting about Trello, and what we are going to be doing on November 2. I begun the day by creating a very short list about what I am going ot say, this took about
      5 minutes of the time. I then did a lot of research on branches and how they work. I have created branches in myapp terminal and I think I have a good understanding of 
      what they are and how they work. I also learned how pull requests are and how they work. With branches and pull requests you can work on the same project with other people. 
      Each person creates there own branch and works on it by themselves then they merge their branches to the master and then all there changes are add to the file. This is what I spent 
      the vast majority of my time doing. I did not do what you mentioned in dicord last night, I will do that at the beginning on monday.

     Today, I tried to fix the bugs in my code that I didn't realize yesterday, some of the bugs I attempeted to fix was the Navigation Bar hover feature. 
     When you hoverd your cursor over the buttons both the tabs would highlight, I don't know why this was happening because on my other code it works perfectly
     fine. Another problem that occured today that is farmillar to me is the underline under the Navigation tasb will not remove, with text decorations, I have 
     decided to leave it for now. I then wanted to get started with my About Me page. I started it off but then I wanted to be creative and have it where you scroll
     to find out stuff. I just started it now so I do not have much.

    At the beginning, Fabien and I worked on our presentation for tomorrow morning. We have written down and memorized so dot point for tomorrow. I then
    begun my editing my code. I seemingly did not do anything to my code but it had a bug I could not find. I spent very long on this and I had to because I 
    could not progress without it. Google did not help me because I did everything correct I just acceidentally deleted a closeing bracket from my function.
    I had to get a second eye on this problem to see the solution. After I solved this problem with help. I then started to learn about API's, 
    I also read up a little on GET requests. Then just like that the day was over.
