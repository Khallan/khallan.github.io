      Today, I finally hosted my react application. I then moved my nav bar over to a seperate file from the app.js to make it less confusing in Explorer tab.
      I have made the nav bar have a function. When I click onto the internship logs it takes you to this page, and when you click onto the home page it takes you back to a 
      blank page. This is going to be temporarily blank. I am going to add a quick about me section on the first page so it is not empty. When you flip back and forth from
      the tabs the nav bar stays while underneath renders, thus saving time and energy. I also learned how to refresh a deployed react app. All in all a very successful day in
      my opinion.
