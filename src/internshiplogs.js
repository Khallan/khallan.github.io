      Today,I finally hosted my react application. I then moved my nav bar over to a seperate file from the app.js to make it less confusing in Explorer tab.
      I have made the nav bar have a function. When I click onto the internship logs it takes you to this page, and when you click onto the home page it takes you back to a 
      blank page. This is going to be temporarily blank. I am going to add a quick about me section on the first page so it is not empty. When you flip back and forth from
      the tabs the nav bar stays while underneath renders, thus saving time and energy. I also learned how to refresh a deployed react app. All in all a very successful day in
      my opinion.

      Today we had a meeting about Trello, and what we are going to be doing on November 2. I begun the day by creating a very short list about what I am going ot say, this took about
      5 minutes of the time. I then did a lot of research on branches and how they work. I have created branches in myapp terminal and I think I have a good understanding of 
      what they are and how they work. I also learned how pull requests are and how they work. With branches and pull requests you can work on the same project with other people. 
      Each person creates there own branch and works on it by themselves then they merge their branches to the master and then all there changes are add to the file. This is what I spent 
      the vast majority of my time doing. I did not do what you mentioned in dicord last night, I will do that at the beginning on monday.
